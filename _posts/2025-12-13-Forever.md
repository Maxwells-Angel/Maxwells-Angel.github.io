> *Like the rock bears the weather/not a lot, just forever.* — Adrienne Lenker
# L-sit 
I practice for one minute every day for a month. Suddenly I can do an L-sit. 
# Achilles 
I watch the gap cut in half, then in half again, then in half again. Still, there is a distance to cross. 
# The messenger 
You hold the emperor's dying message. You beat back the crowds milling in the infinite dwelling places, dreaming of an open field to fly across. 
# The monkeys 
 in a universe more bountiful than ours, typed something resembling how you wish to be remembered. But in this world, you won't be afforded a single error. 
# The ship
It's almost not unbearable to look through the dim glass at the boy you used to know. There was never any break, no bend from day to day. He was right behind the whole way—and yet, somehow, he did not make it. 
# Ocean
I broke the dream to see walls holding us imprisoned. 
"It's a wonder," my lover said, "The maximum of openness in a closed box."
"It's just a skull" 
"And in it, we're free to roam." 
# The Linguist 
In class we learned, from the brain to the nerves to the tongue to the wagging air to the tiny, beating drum to the rolled up piano to the relay station above the bridge to the MGN, and it never really reaches. You imagine it to yourself. The ghost of the thing wakes up and says, I was a human just now, and as it flies away you feel the cold wind from its wings.
