# Hello, my name is Kelechi Nwankwoala  
I'm a cognitive market-researcher turned AI researcher/engineer. 

I’m currently finishing up my batch at the Recurse Center, a self-directed coding retreat, 
where I’ve been focusing on deep learning and mechanistic interpretability.

Outside of programming, I am a bit of a hobby maximalist. I am a fan of almost anything competitive and adrenaline-inducing, (running, cycling, jiu-jitsu, surfing, skiing), arts and crafts related (sewing, drawing, embroidery, writing), and traditionally nerdy or geeky (DnD, chess, boardgames, bird-watching). Generally, if it’s novel, weird, strange, and/or cool, I am a fan. 

# I would summarize my values as 
1. Craft 
2. Humility
3. Human Flourishing
4. Action.
