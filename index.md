title: "Hello, my name is Kelechi Nwankwoala"

I'm a cognitive market-researcher turned AI researcher/engineer. 

I just finished my summer batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), a self-directed coding retreat, 
where I’ve been focusing on deep learning and mechanistic interpretability.

Outside of programming, I tend towards hobby maximalism. I'm an ardent fan of almost anything competitive and adrenaline-inducing, (running, cycling, jiu-jitsu, surfing, skiing), arts and crafts related (sewing, drawing, embroidery, writing), and traditionally nerdy or geeky (DnD, chess, boardgames, bird-watching). Generally, if it’s novel, weird, strange, and/or cool, I am a fan.
