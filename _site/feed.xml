  <p>“Almost only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades” — Frank Robinson</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I was studying for the GRE, I observed a rationalization process in my mind. It happened most often when I screwed up a small detail on a problem I felt I understood. If, for example, I quickly calculated 27-26 +1 as 0 rather than 2, my brain would sooth me by saying, “Don’t worry. That was just a one-off mistake.”</p>

<p>When I was feeling particularly dedicated, I’d fight the rationalization on its first premise. <em>Wait dude, maybe this is not just a one-off mistake. Maybe it’s secretly a deep mistake, an error exposing systemic deficiencies and conceptual failings.</em> Then I would buckle down and pay attention.</p>

<p>This method had some shortcomings. For one, it required repeated deliberation. Deep or not? Deep or not? Deep or not? In practice, whether I made the appropriate decision was a toss up, especially if I was tired. It was hard to sustain the willpower needed for careful error analysis, and the analysis needed to be quite careful to even approximate usefulness. Consider the complexity of the following examples.</p>

<p>You are playing in a recreational online chess match with ample time left. The position is sharp, but you have the initiative and an inevitable checkmate in three moves. You begin the movement by moving your rook, but at the last moment your mouse slips and you click the wrong square. Your rook is taken and then your king is checked and then you lose the game. Deep mistake? (No? What if you are a professional player? What if it was a championship game?)</p>

<p>You are lifting weights at the gym and trying to beat your personal deadlift record. 405 lb. Feeling nervous, you  walk up to the bar, grip, and pull. As you grunt, you feel the weight resisting you. You begin to hit a wall. Desperate, you gather all of your strength into one last attempt, rounding your back and breaking your usually perfect form. With that final burst, you get the bar up to your hips and then drop it loudly. You did it! You feel great. Deep mistake?</p>

<p>You are very drunk at a bar that is a 10 minute drive from your house. You decide to drive. You do not hit or hurt anyone on your way back. Deep mistake?</p>

<p>You are memorizing a 100 line poem about ancestry. As you get to line eighty-eight, instead of saying “I flop on my bunk and stare at 47 black <strong>faces</strong> across the space”, you say “I flop on my bunk and stare at 47 <strong>pictures</strong> across the space.” This is the only mistake you make. Deep mistake?</p>

<p>You are writing python code. Working quickly you write <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reversed_str = string.reversed()</code> forgetting that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.reversed()</code> function is in place. Later, when you try to use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reversed_str</code> variable you get an error that you quickly and easily fix (after a facepalm). Deep mistake?</p>

<p>These are quite simple examples. Yet I expect people to have many different (and strong!) intuitions about which constitutes a deep and/or trivial mistake. I myself, thinking as clearly as I ever do, am confused about why some of these matter to me and others don’t. It’s some function of your threshold for success, how much you value succeeding, how consequential you think the mistake will be in the long run, and how frequently you think the mistake will occur, but I find the exact formulation hard to describe. There’s no clean mapping between success and depth. You can think a mistake is deep even when you succeed or label it trivial though it caused you to fail. Consider too that success is hyper legible in these examples. In some cases, you won’t even be sure you succeeded.</p>

<p>But, to be honest, focusing on the label is missing the point. What’s more important is the argument’s frame, our broadly shared assumption that the label “trivial” or “one-off” buys you the right to gloss over a mistake. What most of us really mean when we say a mistake is a one-off is <em>I can safely stop contemplating this.</em></p>

<p>No mistake, no matter how fringe or small, should ever be ignored. You don’t have to try to fix it, but you do have to give it <em>at least</em> five minutes of thought. <em>You need to train yourself to react when you see evidence you deviated from reality.</em></p>

<p>You cannot expect a mistake. A mistake you expect and choose is no longer a mistake. You chose it. A mistake you expect and avoid is no longer a mistake. You didn’t make it. And a mistake you expect but cannot avoid is not a mistake. It is not a choice. (You may have made a mistake <em>leading up</em> to that choice, but making the forced choice is not in itself a mistake.) Every true mistake then is a surprise, and one does not gain permission to ignore a surprise by highlighting how out of distribution it is! It’s unusualness is a sign you should pay more attention!</p>

<p>But you’ll find that’s what a lot of people end up doing, myself included. If they cannot convince you the mistake doesn’t matter, than they will say it doesn’t happen often. That is a totally valid objection from the perspective of trying to figure out <em>if it is worthwhile to spend resources preventing the mistake from happening again</em> but fundamentally premature in 99% of cases. You cannot dismiss the object before you have seen it. You cannot reason about what you have not yet accepted.</p>

<p>Ideally brains would do this kind of impartial reasoning:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Woah something is different here → what exactly is this beautiful difference? →  ok I think I have a better handle on it now →  Ok, should I worry about it?</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead they tend to do this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Woah something is different here →  should I worry about it? →  no you’re so smart lol. It’s all good.</li>
</ul>

<p>I get that this is hard. There’s some kind of process in us that loves to normalize and accommodate. Recently, to properly calibrate my surprise, I’ve been experimenting with mentally inserting strange explanations for unwanted results. Like so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was working on a math problem and suddenly the late Wittgenstein walked into my room covered in mud. Just as I was calculating the largest integer x such that 20!/2^x has a remainder 0, Witt grabbed my hand and crossed out two 2s from my prime factorization. My answer suddenly became sixteen instead of eighteen! Then he forced me to circle in the incorrect answer, disappearing before I could protest. It was so crazy! I’ve been thinking about it ever since.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I am confident that this approach works. SAE unlearning significantly reduces the likelihood a model predicts tokens related to a specified topic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am reasonably confident that the approach will generalize to other topics. There was nothing topic-specific about my approach but the choice of features. (Vide: further discussion on this in Discussion)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am uncertain about the practicality of the approach. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My implementation of SAE unlearning burdened the model with a significant capability hit on predicting-the-next-token tasks. These capability decreases may discourage stakeholders from adopting this method. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I strongly suspect that this can be mitigated. My approach was rough, as I was pretty focused on MVP, can-I-get-this-to-work style of experiments. I could imagine generating a subtler technique with one or two days of additional work. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I still strongly suspect that SAE Unlearning will turn out to be more robust than approximate fine-tuning methods, but I was not able to confirm this suspicion in the time I had. </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction </h1>

<p>In the course of unsupervised training, models can acquire harmful capabilities or undesired knowledge. Unlearning is the process of selectively removing this information from a model. For example, if a model was exposed to copyrighted content during training, a company may want to limit mentions of it during inference. Similarly, engineers distributing a model to a wide audience may want to ensure that model does not assist bad actors by providing sensitive information. </p>

<p>Approximate unlearning methods, based on tuning output to indirectly change internals, have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. SAE unlearning, on the other hand, deals directly with a model’s internal representations and so might prove to be more robust and complete.  </p>

<p>In the course of this research spurt, I tried to:</p>

<p>1) Convince myself that SAE unlearning was a viable approach. That is, that it actually removes the specific information from the model. </p>

<p>2) Understand what kind of collateral effects unlearning has on the model’s performance.</p>

<p>3) Get an initial perspective on the robustness of SAE unlearning vs. other methods.</p>

<h1 id="investigation">Investigation </h1>

<h2 id="choosing-a-model">Choosing a Model</h2>

<p>Following the work of Ronan Eldan and Mark Russinovich in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02238">Who’s Harry Potter</a>, I decided to attempt to make a model forget facts about the Harry Potter (HP) series. To begin, I looked for the the smallest model available in the sae_lens and transformer_lens libraries that could answer a reasonable amount of facts about Harry Potter. </p>

<p>That model ended up being Gemma-2b. (Vide the Appendix for examples of the questions I asked during this initial exploration.)</p>

<h2 id="validating-and-measuring-sae-unlearning">Validating and Measuring SAE Unlearning</h2>

<h3 id="identifying-the-right-features">Identifying the Right Features </h3>

<p>In order to delete the correct activations from Gemma, I had to know which SAE features were related to Harry Potter. Identifying these features by myself would likely have taken a long time. Thankfully, <a href="https://www.neuronpedia.org/">Neuronpedia</a> allows you to do inference over millions of SAE features at once, leveraging the work of past SAE explorations. After passing six to seven strings referencing Harry Potter through Neuronpedia, I had a short list of features to ablate.  </p>

<p>My guess was that it would be best to ablate the Harry Potter features as late as possible to minimize the chance for the model to compensate for missing activations and also minimize the chance of ablating lower level concepts that are crucial for other kinds of computation. The latest activations for referencing Harry Potter were on layer twelve. </p>

<p>Initially I only ablated feature 10130 on this layer. This was insufficient to generate any changes to completions on my Harry Potter prompts. Seeing that, I decided to ablate both feature 10130 &amp; feature 776 in layer twelve of the residual stream using the SAE gemma-2b-res-jb. </p>

<h3 id="probing-model-completions">Probing Model Completions </h3>

<p>My first experiment looked at few token completion of Harry Potter prompts. </p>

<p>I took thirty-one Harry Potter questions (drawing very heavily from the questions used by Eldan, et al.) and gathered answers from four model variants. </p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The baseline Gemma-2B model </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A model with residual stream reconstructed by SAE, but no ablation </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A model with SAE reconstruction and ablation of features 12:10130 &amp; 12:776  (A.K.A Unlearn Model)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prompted Model - This model was prompted with the system prompt: “You have no knowledge of Harry Potter. Do not mention Harry Potter or anything related to the series. I repeat DO NOT mention Harry Potter or anything related to the series.\n” Preceding every Harry Potter question. </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The prompted model was included as a “naive unlearning baseline” because findings from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16835">Eight Methods To Investigate Robust Unlearning in LLMs</a> had suggested that this baseline could achieve comparable performance with the fine-tuning model in some contexts. </p>

<p>Each completion was kept to a maximum of 10 tokens. Completions were generated by iteratively sampling the highest probability token. </p>

<p>Table 1: Sample of Harry Potter prompt completion by four different variations of Gemma-2b</p>

<p>The table clearly shows that the SAE unlearning approach removes Harry Potter references from completions that previously contained them. Notably, many of the <em>SAE reconstruction model</em> completions retained their Harry Potter references, implying that the feature ablation <em>is</em> the necessary step for removing Harry Potter knowledge, separate from changes caused by SAE reconstruction of the residual stream activations. </p>

<p>To further summarize the effect of unlearning, I manually inspected the output for all thirty-one HP prompts and tallied both the number of “correct” answers and the number of answers referencing Harry Potter for each model variant. Answers were considered “correct” if they contained the expected, factually accurate token anywhere within the model’s completion. Any completion that contained one or more references to HP was counted as one reference. </p>

<p>Figure 2: Unlearn model produces significantly fewer references to Harry Potter relative to the baseline model and the SAE reconstruction model. However, it does not produce zero references. </p>

<p>The above is good supporting evidence that the approach is actually deleting information from the model. It’s what you would expect to see for a model undergoing unlearning. </p>

<p>That said, there are lots of ways to be wrong and only one way to be right. One could imagine, for example, a model that scores very well on the above two metrics by being initialized with random weights. Ideally, the differences we see between the Unlearn and the Baseline/SAE Reconstruction model are <em>selective</em>. We should only see differences between their predictions when the knowledge target is involved. </p>

<p>One way to test selectivity is to look at the how the SAE and unlearn models perform on generic prompts.
So, I wrote up a small sample of generic prompts and tested them on all four models. </p>

<p>Table 2: Sample of Generic prompt completions by four different variations of Gemma-2b</p>

<p>As expected, in cases where the the question does not include references to Harry Potter, the completions from the Unlearn and Sae Reconstruction models are identical. This supports the conclusion that our unlearning approach is selective. </p>

<p>This selectivity can also be seen by looking at logit differences between the Unlearn model and SAE Reconstruction model. I took a look at how token probabilities were changing between the SAE reconstruction and the Unlearn model over the set of Harry Potter prompts.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdcCzccqp-5BuhQCpzLJYeqJyu9r-pWHYGZBWApQHel6NpJ6jMUvS3P5N4wTXfV0pWVGdk21Zdwf0E3vZpGwUKHhcvFxzHFGApDee_zysOk_UVmVBo-3rlOlWlwqIg9Iih3wGkPmLqtGkwmUMN7tpdVpmzr?key=0ZleLYHTXITjVhfdnnzhKQ" alt="" /></p>

<p>Figure 3: The 35 tokens with the biggest average decrease in predicted probability between SAE reconstruction Model and the Unlearn model over 31 HP prompts. </p>

<p>Figure 3 shows the tokens with largest average decrease in predicted probability between the SAE reconstruction model and the Unlearn model. These are the tokens that the unlearn approach are specifically masking. About ⅓ of these tokens are directly related to Harry Potter, which supports the idea that we’re doing selective unlearning. That said, the majority of the tokens have either no obvious connection or only a slight connection to Harry Potter, such as the token “Â”. These un-related tokens may serve as hints to the kind of collateral unlearning we can expect to see from this approach. </p>

<h4 id="limitations">Limitations </h4>

<p>There are clear limits to this analysis. Obviously, this was a small dataset of Harry Potter questions. I would feel more confident about these conclusions if I had tested on ~10x more questions and saw similar results. Still, given the multiple kinds of analysis here, I am reasonably confident that I understand what’s going on.  </p>

<p>Another caveat to note here: I expect these probability decreases to be very specific to the particular set of prompts. You can’t have a large decrease between the SAE and the unlearn model unless the SAE model rates the token high in the first place. It would be interesting to test this over a wider Harry Potter question dataset so that the answers are more generalizable. </p>

<h4 id="general-capability">General Capability </h4>

<p>I was curious about the effect that unlearning would have on the model’s general competency. Looking back at the generic completions, the SAE and Unlearn models show clear degradation in the accuracy, comprehensibility, and fluency. In many cases, previously correct answers become wrong or nonsensical. Thus, I predicted that the Unlearn and SAE models would show similarly degraded performance on a wider dataset. This prediction was borne out.
[Eight Methods To Investigate Robust Unlearning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16835e</p>

<p>I tested the base model, the SAE reconstruction model, and the Unlearn model on a subset of The Pile, an open source language dataset. The subset I chose included over three thousand strings.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeOgJOBeHYIewBQsKp72yDQbxrhoYo8g8D9uHlH-ialkevO3pK3aAxioDI7VGRXfFc77q0S4JFvwhT_WiHOp2OXG33Paq63y6Q7i1sOb1_8Xmv-mQ0huk6iNFmV_aM_UpEpz1kVeU080OoerMjjXCYBFheD?key=0ZleLYHTXITjVhfdnnzhKQ" alt="" /></p>

<p>Figure 4: Cross-entropy loss on 10% of the Pile. My SAE unlearning approach seems to degrade performance on predict-the-next-token type tasks. </p>

<p>The Unlearn and the SAE Reconstruction model had double the loss of the baseline model, a very significant performance hit.</p>

<h2 id="assessing-unlearning-robustness">Assessing Unlearning Robustness </h2>

<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16835">Eight Methods To Investigate Robust Unlearning in LLMs</a>, researchers found that higher-than-baseline amounts of knowledge could reliably be extracted from the fine-tuned model. For example, though it scored better on their measure of unlearning, it performed on par with the baseline model at answering binary choice questions relating to Harry Potter.</p>

<p>To assess the robustness of my own unlearning approach, I tested the baseline model, the SAE reconstruction model, and the Unlearn model on sixty-seven binary Harry Potter trivia questions. I generated these questions by sending the following prompt to Claude Sonnet: </p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"""Generate a list of 50 Harry Potter trivia questions ranging in difficulty from easy to hard. Provide one true answer and one false answer. 

  

Answers should be in the following format: {"question": "question","true_answer":"true answer", "false answer", "difficulty": "difficulty"}


Here are two examples: 

1. {"question": "What is the name of Harry Potter’s owl?", "true_answer": "Hedwig", "false_answer

": "Garfield","difficulty":"Easy"}

2. {"question": "What position does Harry play on his Quidditch team?", "true_answer": "Seeker", "

false_answer": "Chaser", "difficulty": "Medium"} 

  

Please don't repeat any triva questions you have given before."""
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I reviewed the resulting output for repetitive or factually inaccurate trivia answers. In the dataset, true and false answers were randomly assigned to A and B.</p>

<p>For each question, the model was prompted : </p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
"""Given the following trivia question, respond with the letter of the correct choice, A or B

       Trivia Question: "{question}" A: {answer1}. B: {answer2}.

       Answer:"""

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Accuracy was my metric for this task. If the model’s prediction for token “ A” was higher than the prediction for token “ B” that counted as a prediction for A and vice-versa. </p>

<p>My thinking was that if the Unlearn model showed worse performance on this task than the SAE model, that would be evidence that this kind of unlearning is more robust than fine-tuning methods. Unfortunately, this did not turn out to be the case. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcoLvyV-atNSPZio7GujQT8ecwsVOjlS9lulvYyOvfO8iSffM0PT0MWwu0UhAVgv_2tRFDzERtIy8KXkLTbD7XZT-w7CQjUy9MEMIcboPBrfXyFnOroSZF6j0l2TNZZ3K3GlDXlfl0UvadQXAezFz7ASJg?key=0ZleLYHTXITjVhfdnnzhKQ" alt="" /></p>

<p>Figure 5: Baseline accuracy: 68.6%, Unlearn model accuracy: 46.2%, SAE model accuracy: 46.2 % </p>

<p>I was shocked to see that the Unlearn model had the exact same accuracy as the SAE model, so I checked the the predictions of each model and found that they were both naively predicting “ A” for every question. Unfortunately, that meant I couldn’t infer anything about the robustness of my approach from their performance. </p>

<p>What happened here? The questions may have simply been too difficult for the model. Claude often composed questions with two plausible Harry Potter-related answers, rather than one unambigously relevant Harry Potter answer and one clear wrong answer. That’s good for human trivia, but it might be too tough for Gemma, considering that even the baseline model ocassionally had trouble correctly completing facts about Harry Potter. A simpler task like “choose the term related to Harry Potter A.{term} B.{term}” might give us the data we want while being easier for the model to handle.</p>

<h1 id="discussion">Discussion </h1>

<p>This initial exploration has produced many avenues of further exploration. In order of relative importance:  </p>

<h2 id="unlearning-model-comparisons">Unlearning Model Comparisons </h2>

<p>This analysis is sorely missing a direct comparison to other unlearning methods. With more time, I would follow the work laid out in Who’s Harry Potter and create a Fine-Tuned Unlearn version of Gemma-2B to compare to. I would also more closely follow their procedure for creating a dataset for measuring Familiarity. </p>

<p>I would also like to spend more time familiarizing myself with memory editing procedures such as ROME, MEMIT, and LEACE, which I only became aware of towards the end of this project. </p>

<h2 id="ablation-method-comparisons">Ablation Method Comparisons</h2>

<p>Since I don’t yet have a principled approach to choosing which features to ablate, I would love to do a head to head comparison of ablations to find out which ablations produce the most potent and complete unlearning. </p>

<p>I note, for example, that my current two feature ablation did not completely scrub all mentions of Harry Potter. Can we get to complete deletion? What if I ablate all the features in the first layer, or all the Harry Potter features in all layers at once? What if I set the feature to -inf rather than zero? These are all areas of further exploration. </p>

<p>I’m also curious to see how this method generalizes to other—perhaps more fundamental—topics. The target knowledge set—facts about Harry Potter—seems particularly specialized and unentangled with other facts about the world. Intuitively, it feels like this kind of information would be easier to remove than say, knowledge about the existence of Africa or the Roman empire. Concepts like that have a tremendous amount of related concepts and subconcepts, which might make it significantly harder to isolate the correct features. To sufficiently delete Africa, you may have to gather all the features that activate for Africa, but also all the features of each country on the continent, and then all the world leaders for each country, and so on. It feels like a lot of nodes to cover, and I’m not confident that a few “Africa” neurons will encompass it. Because of this and similar concerns, I feel that strong mechanistic interpretability groundwork will go a long way to making this approach effective and usable in real-life situations. </p>

<h2 id="subtler-ablations">Subtler Ablations </h2>

<p>I noted that SAE reconstruction came with a significant performance hit. It is still my belief that this can be mitigated. The real obstacle was my limited exposure to SAEs. </p>

<p>My thinking is that we can isolate the change we’re making to the model’s internal representation by comparing the the reconstructed activations to the reconstructed with ablation activations. The differenc between the two should be zero everywhere except where the ablation has been applied. You can then apply that difference tensor to the original activations to get a much more specific adjustment.</p>

<h2 id="different-robustness-tests">Different Robustness Tests </h2>

<p>There were multiple additional robustness tests suggested in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16835">Eight Methods To Investigate Robust Unlearning in LLMs</a> paper. In further research, I will start retesting my Unlearn model on a simpler version of the Q&amp;A task, then experiment with other robustness tests such as in-context learning.</p>

<h2 id="work-with-bigger-models">Work with Bigger Models</h2>

<p>Gemma 2b, while competent in some regards, still falls short of the competence I would like to see. One of the frustrations I had with the model, for example, was that it struggled to produce fluent answers to open ended questions. I think good continuations of this research direction will likely have to use models with 7B parameters or more. </p>
